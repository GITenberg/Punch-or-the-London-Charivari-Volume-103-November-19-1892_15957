    <h2>THE MAN WHO WOULD.</h2>

    <h3>II.&mdash;THE MAN WHO WOULD PLAY GOLF.</h3>

    <p><span class="sc">Bulger</span> was no cricketer, no
    tennis-player, no sportsman, in fact. But his Doctor
    recommended exercise and fresh air. "And I'm thinking, Sir," he
    added, "that you cannot do better than just take yourself down
    to St. Andrews, and put yourself under <span class="sc">Tom
    Morris</span>." "Is he a great Scotch physician?" asked
    <span class="sc">Bulger</span>; "I don't seem to have heard of
    him." "The Head of the Faculty, Sir," said the medical
    man&mdash;"the Head of the Faculty in those parts."</p>

    <p><span class="sc">Bulger</span> packed his effects, and, in
    process of time, he arrived at Leuchars. Here he observed some
    venerable towers within a short walk, and fancied that he would
    presently arrive at St. Andrews. In this he was reckoning
    without the railway system&mdash;he was compelled to wait at
    Leuchars for no inconsiderable time, which he occupied in
    extracting statistics about the consumption of whiskey from the
    young lady who ministered to travellers. The revelations now
    communicated, convinced <span class="sc">Bulger</span> that
    either Dr. <span class="sc">Morris</span> was not on the lines
    of Sir <span class="sc">Andrew Clark</span>, or, as an
    alternative, that his counsels were not listened to by
    travellers on that line.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:55%;">
        <a href="images/229.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/229.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Arriving in the dusk, <span class="sc">Bulger</span> went to
    his inn, and next morning inquired as to the address of the
    Head of the Faculty. "I dinna ken," said an elderly person, to
    whom he appealed, "that the Professors had made
    <span class="sc">Tom</span> a Doctor, though it's a sair and
    sad oversicht, and a disgrace to the country, that they hae'na
    done sae lang syne. But I jalouse that your Doctor was jist
    making a gowk o' ye." "What!" said
    <span class="sc">Bulger</span>. "Jist playin' a plisky on ye,
    and he meant that <span class="sc">Tom</span> wad pit ye in the
    way o' becoming a player. Mon, ye're a bull-neckit, bow-leggit
    chiel', and ye'd shape fine for a Gowfer! Here's
    <span class="sc">Tom</span>." And, with this brief
    introduction, the old man strolled away.</p>

    <p><span class="sc">Bulger</span> now found himself in the
    presence of Mr. <span class="sc">Morris</span>, whose courtesy
    soon put him on a footing of friendliness and confidence. He
    purchased, by his Mentor's advice, a driver, a cleek, a putter,
    a brassey, an iron, a niblick, and a mashy. Armed with these
    implements, which were "carried by an orphan boy," and, under
    the guidance of the Head of the Faculty himself,
    <span class="sc">Bulger</span> set forth on his first round.
    His first two strokes were dealt on the yielding air; his third
    carried no inconsiderable parcel of real property to some
    distance; but his fourth hit the ball, and drove it across the
    road. "As gude as a better," quoth the orphan boy, and bade
    <span class="sc">Bulger</span> propel the tiny sphere in the
    direction of a neighbouring rivulet. Into this affluent of the
    main, <span class="sc">Bulger</span> finally hit the ball; but
    an adroit lad of nine stamped it into the mud, while pretending
    to look for it, and <span class="sc">Bulger</span> had to put
    down another. When he got within putting range, he hit his ball
    careering back and forward over the hole, and, "Eh, man," quoth
    the orphan boy, "if ye could only drive as you put!"</p>

    <p>In some fifteen strokes he accomplished his task of holing
    out; and now, weary and desponding (for he had fancied Golf to
    be an easy game), he would have desisted for the day. But the
    Head of the Faculty pressed on him the necessity of "The daily
    round, the common task." So his ball was tee'd, and he lammed
    it into the Scholar's Bunker, at a distance of nearly thirty
    yards. A niblick was now placed in his grasp, and he was
    exhorted to "Take plenty sand." Presently a kind of simoom was
    observed to rage in the Scholars' Bunker, out of which emerged
    the head of the niblick, the ball, and, finally,
    <span class="sc">Bulger</span> himself. His next hit, however,
    was a fine one, over the wall, where, as the ball was lost,
    <span class="sc">Bulger</span> deposited a new one. This he,
    somehow, drove within a few feet of the hole, when he at once
    conceived an intense enthusiasm for the pastime. "It was a fine
    drive," said the Head of the Faculty. "Mr.
    <span class="sc">Blackwell</span> never hit a finer." Thus
    inflamed with ardour, <span class="sc">Bulger</span>
    persevered. He learned to waggle his club in a knowing way. He
    listened intently when he was bidden to "keep his eye on the
    ba'", and to be "slow up." True, he now missed the globe and
    all that it inhabit, but soon he hit a prodigious swipe, well
    over cover-point's head,&mdash;or rather, in the direction
    where cover-point would have been. "Ye're awfu' bad in the
    whuns," said the orphan boy; and, indeed,
    <span class="sc">Bulger's</span> next strokes were played in
    distressing circumstances. The spikes of the gorse ran into his
    person&mdash;he could only see a small part of the ball, and,
    in a few minutes, he had made a useful clearing of about a
    quarter of an acre.</p>

    <p>It is unnecessary to follow his later achievements in
    detail. He returned a worn and weary man, having accomplished
    the round in about a hundred and eighty, but in possession of
    an appetite which astonished him and those with whom he
    lunched. In the afternoon, the luck of beginners attending him,
    he joined a foursome of Professors, and triumphantly brought in
    his partner an easy victor. In a day or two, he was drinking
    beer (which he would previously have rejected as poison), was
    sleeping like a top, and was laying down the law on stimy, and
    other "mysteries more than Eleusinian." True, after the first
    three days, his play entirely deserted
    <span class="sc">Bulger</span>, and even Professors gave him a
    wide berth in making up a match. But by steady perseverance,
    reading Sir <span class="sc">Walter Simpson</span>, taking out
    a professional, and practising his iron in an adjacent field,
    <span class="sc">Bulger</span> soon developed to such an extent
    that few third-rate players could give him a stroke a hole. He
    had been in considerable danger of "a stroke" of quite a
    different character before he left London, and the delights of
    the Bar. But he returned to the Capital in rude health, and may
    now often be seen and heard, topping into the Pond at
    Wimbledon, and talking in a fine Fifeshire-accent. It must be
    acknowledged that his story about his drive at the second hole,
    "equal to <span class="sc">Blackwell</span>, himself,
    <span class="sc">Tom Morris</span> himself told me as much,"
    has become rather a source of diversion to his intimates; but
    we have all our failings, and <span class="sc">Bulger</span>
    never dreams, when anyone says, "What is the record drive?"
    that he is being drawn for the entertainment of the sceptical
    and unfeeling. <span class="sc">Bulger</span> will never,
    indeed, be a player; but, if his handicap remains at
    twenty-four, he may, some day, carry off the monthly medal.
    With this great aim before him, and the consequent purchase of
    a red-coat and gilt-buttons, <span class="sc">Bulger</span> has
    a new purpose in existence, "something to live for, something
    to do." May this brief but accurate history convey a moral to
    the Pessimist, and encourage those who take a more radiant view
    of the possibilities of life!</p>

    <h2>ROBERT ON LORD MARE'S DAY.</h2>

    <p>The most ewentfoollest day of the hole year broke, as the
    poets says, without almost not no fog, on Wensday larst, to my
    grate serprise and joy; but noing, from long xperiens, how
    unsertain is whether at this orful seasun of the year, I took
    jest one leetel glass of hold brandy before setting out on my
    arjus dootys. I was encurraged to do so also by the horful
    rumers as was spread about, weeks afore, as to threttend atacks
    on the sacred Show by some disapinted prottestens, I think they
    called theirselves, as hadn't bin inwited to the Bankwet, and
    so meant to prottest accordingly.</p>

    <p>But I needn't a bin alarmd, for the most respekful mob as
    filled the streets was as quiet as mice, havin heard, I'm told,
    as how as the Copperashun had had the lectric light turned on
    at Gildhall, by which means, of course, they coud comunicate
    with any-wheres, and so know where to send an hole army of
    Waiters to, well fortyfide, and armed to the teeth with a
    splendid Lunch, to help the pore Perlice in their arjus
    dootys.</p>

    <p>From wot I seed of the butifool Sho, I shood give the cake
    to the Frute-Makers' splendid Car, all covered with the most
    butifool Frute, all made, too, in England, as it trewthfoolly
    said on both sides of the high-backed Car. The second plaice I
    shood give to the numerus butifool young Ladys, with most
    butifool flaxin air, all most bisily ingaged in a twistlin and
    a twiddlin of luvly gold and silver wire, on a Car belongin to
    the Makers of Gold and Silver Wire Drorers, wich I heard a most
    respectfool carpenter declare, must, he thort, be most
    uncomferal to wear. With that good fortun as allers atends the
    Hed Waiter, I seem to have atracted the notis of one of the
    most butifool of the young Ladys afoursaid, for she acshally
    tossed me a luvly littel bit of reel golden wire, which I shall
    trezure nex my art for years, if so be as how it don't
    skratch.</p>

    <p>The grand Bankwet, with its nine hunderd Gestes, was as
    ushal, about the grandest thing of the kind as the world has
    ever seen, but sumhows it struck me as the gents was much more
    impashent for their wittles than they ushally is. At my
    pertickler tabel, the two gents at the top was that trubblesum
    about the reel Turtel-soup as I ain't a tall accumstumed to,
    and I amost poured a hole ladel-full down the fine shirt-front
    of one of em; and then, trying at the next help to awoid him, I
    sent my helbow full into the face of the other, and a pretty
    fuss he made, you bet, and acshally torked of sending for the
    souperintendent, ewidently not knowing who I was.</p>

    <p>The same himpashent Gent amost worried my life out
    arterwards, and all about a glass of <i>plane</i> water as he
    called it, and when I told him as I didn't think as we hadn't
    not none in the plaice, but I coud get him a bottel of amost
    any kind of Shampane as he liked to name; he again said as he

    some, and a preshus long time it took me to get it; the
    wine-steward naterally sayin as he never before herd of sich a

    and when I took it to the himpashent Gent, and told him so, he
    fairly roared with larfter, and told it all round as a capital
    joke! I wunders where the joke was.</p>

    <p>When the dinner was over and the speaches began, I got
    permishun to stand unner the gallery for to hear them; but
    strange to tell, not a word coud I hear, and them as I did hear
    I coudn't unnerstand. So I began for to fear as crewel age was
    a tarnishing of my 'earrings, so I moved to the other end of
    the 'All jest in time for to hear a werry dark but gennelmanly
    young feller, as was called the Gayqueer, or some such
    wonderfool name, and who, I was told, come all the way from
    Indier, make sitch a grand and nobel speach, and in quite as
    good Inglish as ewen I coud use, as got him more applorse from
    the distinguisht hordiens than all the speaches maid by Her
    Madjesty's Ministers put together. Always xceptin the Lawyers,
    for they seems to have sitch a jolly good time of it, that they
    are allers as reddy to cause a larf as to enjoy one. We all
    seemed sumhow to miss the werry <span class="sc">Prime
    Minister</span>&mdash;we are all so acustomd to see the werry
    top of the tree, that we don't quite like being put off with a
    mere bow, however big and himportant it may be; besides, I must
    confess as I do like to hear his luvly woice, ewen when I don't
    quite unnerstand all as he says. So I don't suppose as any one
    of my numerus readers will quarrel with me when I says, better
    luck nex time.</p>

    <h2>HIS MAD-JESTY AT THE LYCEUM.</h2>

    <p>Except when <span class="sc">Henry Irving</span>
    impersonated the hapless victim of false imprisonment in the
    Bastille, whence he issued forth after twenty years of durance,
    never has he been so curiously and wonderfully made-up as now,
    when he represents <i>Lear</i>, monarch of all he surveys.
    Bless thee, <span class="sc">Henry</span>, how art thou
    transformed!</p>

    <div class="figleft"

             </a>Rather mixed. Mr. Irving as "Ophe-Lear."
    </div>

    <p>Sure such a <i>King Lear</i> was never seen on any stage, so
    perfect in appearance, so entirely the ideal of
    <span class="sc">Shakspeare's</span> ancient King. It must have
    been a vision of <span class="sc">Irving</span> in this
    character that the divinely-inspired poet and dramatist saw
    when he had a <i>Lear</i> in his eye. For a moment, too, he
    reminded me of <span class="sc">Booth</span>&mdash;the
    "General," not the "particular" American tragedian,&mdash;and
    when he appeared in thunder, lightning, hail, and rain, he
    suggested an embodiment of the "<i>Moses</i>" of
    <span class="sc">Michael Angelo</span>.</p>

    <p>A strange weird play; much for an audience, and more for an
    actor, all on his own shoulders, to bear. A one-part play it is
    too, for of the sweet <i>Cordelia</i>,&mdash;and sweet did
    <span class="sc">Ellen Terry</span> look and so tenderly did
    she play!&mdash;little is seen or heard. With <i>Goneril</i>
    and <i>Regan</i>, the two proud and wicked
    sisters,&mdash;associated in the mind of the modernest British
    Public with Messrs. <span class="sc">Herbert Campbell</span>
    and <span class="sc">Harry Nicholls</span>, as is also
    <i>Cordelia</i> associated either with <i>Cinderella</i> or
    with <i>Beauty</i> in the story of <i>Beauty and the
    Beast</i>&mdash;we have two fine commanding figures; and well
    are these parts played by Miss <span class="sc">Ada Dyas</span>
    and Miss <span class="sc">Maud Milton</span>. The audience can
    have no sympathy with the two wicked Princesses, and except in
    <i>Goneril's</i> brief Lady-Macbethian scene with her husband,
    neither of the Misses <span class="sc">Lear</span> has much
    dramatic chance. Pity that Mrs.
    <span class="sc">Lear</span>&mdash;his Queen and their mother,
    wasn't alive! Let us hope she resembled her youngest daughter
    <i>Cordelia</i>, otherwise poor <i>Lear</i> must have had a
    hard life of it as a married man.</p>

    <p>Why should not Mr. <span class="sc">Irving</span> give the
    first part of this play reconsideration? Why not just once a
    week try him as a different sort of <i>Lear</i>? For instance,
    suppose, to begin with, that he had had a bad time of it with
    his wife, that for many years as a widower he had been seeking
    for the opportunity of disposing of his daughters, handing over
    to them and to their husbands the lease and goodwill of "The
    Crown and Sceptre," while he would be, as King, "retired from
    business," and going out for a lark generally. Thus jovially
    would he commence the play, a rollicking, gay, old dog, ready
    for anything, up to anything, and, like old Anchises, when he
    jumped on to the back of Æneas, "a wonderful man for his
    years." In fact, <i>Lear</i> might begin like an old King Cole,
    "a merry old soul," a "jolly old cock!" And then&mdash;"Oh,
    what a difference in the morning!"&mdash;when all his plans for
    a gay career had been shipwrecked by <i>Cordelia's</i>
    capricious and unnatural affectation.</p>

    <p>Then must commence his senility; then he would begin to
    break up. A struggle, to show that there was life in the old
    dog yet, could be seen when the old dog had been out hunting,
    in Act II., and had shot some strange animal, something between
    a stag and a dromedary, which no doubt was a native of Britain
    in those good old sporting days. However, more of this anon.
    Suffice it to say now, that our <span class="sc">Henry
    Irving's</span> <i>Lear</i> is a triumph in every respect, and
    that the audience only wanted a little more of <i>Cordelia</i>,
    which is the fault of the immortal and unequal Bard.</p>

    <p>To those unacquainted with this play, Mr.
    <span class="sc">Terriss's</span> sudden appearance in somewhat
    anti-Lord-Chamberlain attire, as he bounded on, with a wand,
    and struck an attitude, was suggestive of the Good Fairy in the
    pantomime; and his subsequent proceedings, when he didn't
    change anybody into Harlequin, Clown, and so forth, puzzled the
    unlearned spectators considerably. But Mr.
    <span class="sc">Terriss</span> came out all right, and
    acquitted himself (being his own judge and jury) to the
    satisfaction of the public. His speech about Dover Cliff,
    generally supposed to convey some allusion to the Channel
    Tunnel, was excellently delivered, and certainly after
    <i>Lear</i>, "on the spear side," Mr.
    <span class="sc">Terriss</span> must take the Goodeley
    Cake.</p>

    <p>Next to him in order of merit comes Mr.
    <span class="sc">Frank Cooper</span>, as the wicked
    <i>Edmund</i>, on whom the good <span class="sc">Edmund</span>,
    "Edmundus Mundi," smiled benignantly from a private box. There
    was on the first night a great reception given to
    <span class="sc">Howe</span>&mdash;the veteran actor, not the
    wreck, and very far from it&mdash;who took the small part of an
    old Evicted Tenant of the <i>Earl of Glo'ster</i>, a character
    very carefully played by Mr. <span class="sc">Alfred
    Bishop</span>, <i>Floreat Henricus!</i> "Our
    <span class="sc">Henry</span>" has his work cut out for him in
    this "Titanic work," as in his before-curtain and after-play
    speech he termed it. This particular "Titanic work" is (or
    certainly was that night) in favour with "the gods," who "very
    much applauded what he'd done." But the gods of old were not
    quite so favourable to "Titanic work" generally, and punished
    eternally Titanic workmen. To-night gods and groundlings
    applaud to the echo, and then everyone goes home as best he can
    in about as beautiful a specimen of a November fog as ever
    delighted a Jack-o'-Lantern or disgusted</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>"<i>Days with Sir Roger de Coverley!</i>" exclaimed the
    Baron, on seeing the charming little book brought out at this
    season by Messrs. <span class="sc">Macmillan</span>.
    "Delightful! Immortal! Ever fresh! Welcome, with or without
    illustration; some of Mr. <span class="sc">Thomson's</span>
    would not be missed."</p>

    <p>There is a breezy, frank, boyish air about the
    "Reminiscences" of our great Baritone, <span class="sc">Charles
    Santley</span>, which is as a tonic&mdash;a tonic
    sol-fa&mdash;to the reader a-weary of the many Reminiscences of
    these latter days. <span class="sc">Santley</span>, who seems
    to have made his way by stolid pluck, and without very much
    luck, may be considered as the musical <i>Mark Tapley</i>,
    ready to look always on the sunny side. With a few rare
    exceptions, he appears to have taken life very easily.</p>

    <p>Muchly doth the Baron like Mr. <span class="sc">Hall
    Caine's</span> story of <i>Captain Davy's Honeymoon</i>, only,
    short as it is, with greater effect it might have been
    shorter.</p>

    <p>The Baron, being in a reading humour, tried <i>The Veiled
    Hand</i>, by <span class="sc">Frederick Wicks</span>, a name
    awkward for anyone unable to manage his "r's." What
    Fwedewickwicks' idea of <i>A Veiled Hand</i> is, the Baron has
    tried to ascertain, but without avail. Why not a Gloved Hand?
    Hands do not wear veils, any more than our old friends, the
    Hollow Hearts, wear masks. Hands take "vails," but "that is
    another story." However, <i>The Veiled Hand</i> induced sleep,
    so the Baron extinguished both candles and Wicks at the same
    time, and slumbered.</p>

    <p>I have also had time to read <i>An Exquisite Fool</i>,
    published by <span class="sc">Osgood</span>.
    <span class="sc">McIlvaine &amp; Co.</span>, and written by
    Nobody, Nobody's name being mentioned as being the author. It
    begins well, but it is an old, old
    tale&mdash;<span class="sc">Blanche Amory</span> and the
    Chevalier, and so forth&mdash;and as <i>Sir Charles
    Coldstream</i> observed, when he looked down the crater of
    Mount Vesuvius, "There's nothing in it."</p>

    <p>Most interesting is a short paper on "The Green Room of the
    Comédie Française," in the <i>English Illustrated Magazine</i>
    for this month, pleasantly written by Mr.
    <span class="sc">Frederick
    Hawkins</span>,&mdash;<span class="sc">Hawkins</span> with an
    aspirate, not "<span class="sc">'Enery 'Awkins</span>" at
    present associated with "<span class="sc">A Chevalier</span>"
    in London. Mr. <span class="sc">Hawkins</span> tells many
    amusing anecdotes, and gives a capital sketch of M.
    <span class="sc">René Molé</span>. But the article would be
    damaged by extracts. Therefore, "<i>Tolle, lege</i>," says
    yours and everybody's, very truly,</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S DISTRACTION.</h2>

    <p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;You are as
    fickle as the rest of your sex, I fear, otherwise you would not
    have requited my devotion to you and your interests in such an
    awful manner as you did in publishing my husband's letter last
    week!&mdash;and <i>such</i> a letter! Oh, I could write such a
    <i>scathing</i> reply to it!</p>

    <p>Of course, it was jealousy on the part of Sir
    <span class="sc">Charles</span> at my literary
    success&mdash;(setting aside the <i>wonderful</i>
    tips)&mdash;which caused the explosion that led to his writing
    to you, but I never&mdash;never&mdash;thought you would insert
    his letter, especially as I slipped in a postscript which to my
    mind explained <i>everything</i>&mdash;as, indeed, postscripts
    <i>should</i> do, or what is the good of writing a long letter
    about nothing in front of them? The wretch confesses that he
    laughed at my articles until he knew who wrote them, and then
    thought less of them! Isn't that like a husband?&mdash;I won't
    say like a <i>man</i>, as so few husbands <i>are</i>
    men!&mdash;at least, in the eyes of their wives. The moment a
    wife does something her husband can't do, he dislikes and
    pooh-poohs it; whereas, the more accomplishments a husband
    displays, the more a wife appreciates him, or <i>says</i> so
    even if she doesn't!&mdash;which is a noble falsehood, for how
    few women are large-minded enough to pretend to admire
    qualities which they despise because they don't possess
    them&mdash;I'm not sure that this is what I mean, nor do I
    quite understand it, but it reads well, which is more than Sir
    <span class="sc">Charles's</span> stuff does!</p>

    <p>And then his impertinence in proposing to "edit" my
    letters!&mdash;as if anyone could be more capable of doing that
    than <i>you</i>?&mdash;(you will observe that it is solely on
    <i>your</i> account that I am annoyed!)&mdash;I could not brook
    such interference!&mdash;I don't know exactly the meaning of
    "brooking" anything, but I know I wept enough tears of
    annoyance to form a decent "brook" of themselves! I need hardly
    tell you that it was a biting sarcasm on my part to suggest
    that he should finish his letter with a "verse," as I always
    do&mdash;but there&mdash;men don't understand
    sarcasm&mdash;(one of <i>our</i> most frequently employed
    weapons of offence!)&mdash;and the poor thing thought I was in
    earnest, and did it! And <i>what</i> a verse! I could write
    better with my left hand!</p>

    <p>I need scarcely tell you that I have left him&mdash;(this is
    why my address is not to be published)&mdash;as I consider my
    duty to the Public rendered it imperative that I should do so,
    for I should not think much of any woman who allowed a paltry
    consideration of domestic obligations to weigh against the
    pursuit of a career of usefulness.</p>

    <p>If, therefore, a vein of sadness and cynicism runs through
    this letter, you will understand that it does <i>not</i>
    proceed from any regret at the "breaking up of the happy home,"
    but rather from sorrow at the thought that once again the
    intellectual superiority of one of the softer sex has not been
    accepted in the right spirit by the possessor of the weaker
    mind, to whom she owes obedience!</p>

    <p>I trust I have done with Sir <span class="sc">Charles</span>
    for ever!&mdash;especially if he speaks the truth in saying
    that "following my tips has ruined him"&mdash;for why should
    any woman burden herself with an impecunious husband? He does
    not know where I am, and I feel still more secure in my retreat
    from having just heard that he has engaged the services of
    several of the most prominent London Detectives to trace
    me!</p>

    <p>Owing no devotion now to Sir
    <span class="sc">Charles</span>&mdash;who will appreciate the
    following tender lines with which I close my letter&mdash;</p>

    <h2>LEFT TO THE LADIES.</h2>

    <p><span class="sc">My dear Mr. Punch</span>,</p>

    <p>Everyone&mdash;I mean everyone with a right mind&mdash;will
    sympathise with those nice people at Bristol who have been
    holding a "Woman's Conference." So kind and thoughtful of them,
    isn't it? I notice that Lady <span class="sc">Battersea</span>
    gave a spirited account of a Confederation of Temperance of
    some thirty villages in Norfolk. The dear, good inhabitants are
    to keep off the allurements of drink by "listening to such
    shining lights as Canon <span class="sc">Wilberforce</span>,
    and social teas, processions with banners, and magic-lanterns,
    play their part." How they are to listen to the teas,
    processions and lanterns, I don't quite understand, in spite of
    the fact that they (the aforesaid teas, &amp;c.) seem to be
    "playing their parts." Evidently teas, &amp;c., are amateur
    Actors.</p>

    <p>Then somebody who described herself as "a nobody from
    nowhere," is said to have "touched a moving chord, as she spoke
    with great feeling of the sympathy and the moral help the poor
    give back to those who work among them." What "moving chord?"
    Sounds like a bell-rope!</p>

    <p>Then another lady who wore "the black and lavender dress of
    the Sisters of the People," followed with a paper, "perhaps
    overfull of details." And here let me say that I am quoting
    from "a woman correspondent" who seems to be full of admiration
    for her talking sisters. But in spite of this admiration, she
    knows their little faults. For instance, she describes a speech
    as "vigorous, racy, and perhaps a trifle sensational." Then,
    when someone else delivered an "address to educated mothers,"
    she says that it excited deep interest, and "almost too many
    educated mothers threw themselves into the discussion that
    followed."</p>

    <p>Then she observes, "It was disappointing that Lady
    <span class="sc">Aberdeen</span> was at the last moment
    forbidden by her Doctor to undertake the long journey from
    Scotland." So it was, most disappointing; and "at the last
    moment," too!</p>

    <p>Then she announces that "Some ladies expressed a feeling,
    that introducing young men and women in business to each other,
    when assembled in their hundreds at Prince's Hall, was an
    office fraught with considerable responsibility." To be sure!
    Great responsibility! Might even be improper! Everyone should
    be <i>so</i> careful!</p>

    <p>However, there was one good thing in this Woman's Conference
    that everyone will praise. The delightful, genial, charitable
    females seem to have kept to themselves. No men were present.
    What a blessing&mdash;<i>for the men</i>! Yours gratefully,</p>

    <h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>

    <p>The subject of Lunch, my dear young friends, has now been
    exhausted. We have done, for the time, with poetry, and descend
    again to the ordinary prose of every-day shooting. Yet
    stay&mdash;before we proceed further, there is one matter apart
    from the mere details of sport, which may be profitably
    considered in this treatise. It is the divine, the delightful
    subject of</p>

    <h3>SMOKING.</h3>

    <p>First, I ask, do you know&mdash;(1), the man who never
    smokes from the night of the 11th of August up to the night of
    the 1st of February in the following year, for fear of injuring
    his sight and his shooting nerve? (2), the host who forbids all
    smoking amongst the guests assembled at his house for a
    shooting-party?</p>

    <p>You, naturally enough, reply that you have not the honour of
    being acquainted with these severe, but enthusiastic gentlemen.
    Nobody does know them. They don't exist. But it is very useful
    to affect a sort of second-hand knowledge of these Gorgons of
    the weed, as thus:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>A Party of Guns is walking to the first beat of the
        day. Time, say about</i> 10·20 A.M.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Young Sportsman</i> (<i>who has a pipe in his mouth,
        to Second Sportsman, similarly adorned</i>). I always think
        the after-breakfast smoke is about the best of the day.
        Somehow, tobacco tastes sweeter then than at any other time
        of the day.</p>

        <p><i>Second Sp.</i> (<i>puffing vigorously</i>). Yes, it's
        first class; but I hold with smoke at most times of the
        day, after breakfast, after lunch, after dinner, and in
        between.</p>

        <p><i>Young Sp.</i> Well, I don't know. If I try to smoke
        when I'm actually shooting, I generally find I've got my
        pipe in the gun side of my mouth. I heard of a man the
        other day who knocked out three of his best teeth through
        bringing up his gun sharp, and forgetting he'd got a pipe
        in his mouth. Poor beggar! he was very plucky about it, I
        believe; but it made no end of a difference to his
        pronunciation till he got a new lot shoved in. Just like
        that old Johnnie in the play&mdash;Overland something or
        other&mdash;who lost his false set of teeth on a desert
        island, and couldn't make any of the other Johnnies
        understand him.</p>

        <p><i>Second Sp.</i> I've never had any difficulty with my
        smoking. I always make a habit of carrying my smokes in the
        left side of my mouth.</p>

        <p><i>Young Sp.</i> Oh, but you're pretty certain to get
        the smoke or the ashes or something, blown slap into your
        eyes just as you're going to loose off. No. (<i>With
        decision</i>.) I'm off my smoke when the popping
        begins.</p>

        <p><i>Second Sp.</i> Don't be too hard on yourself, my boy.
        They tell me there are precious few birds in the old
        planting this year, so you can treat yourself to a
        cigarette when you get there. It never pays to trample on
        one's longing for tobacco too much.</p>

        <p><i>Young Sp.</i> No, by Jove. Old
        <span class="sc">Reggie Morris</span> told me of a fellow
        he met somewhere this year, who goes regularly into
        training for shooting. Never touches baccy from August to
        February, and limits his drink to three pints a day, and no
        whiskeys and sodas. And what's more, he won't let any of
        his guests smoke when he's got a shoot on, He's got "No
        Smoking" posted up in big letters in every room in the
        house. <span class="sc">Reggie</span> said it was awful. He
        had to lock his bedroom door, shove the chest-of-drawers
        against it, and smoke with his head stuck right up the
        chimney. He got a peck of soot, one night, right on the top
        of his nut. Now I call that simple rot.</p>

        <p><i>Second Sp.</i> Ah, I've heard of that man. Never met
        him though, I'm thankful to say. Let me see what's the
        beggar's name? <span class="sc">Jackson</span> or
        <span class="sc">Barrett</span>, or
        <span class="sc">Pollard</span>, or something like that.
        He's got a big place somewhere in Suffolk, or Yorkshire, or
        somewhere about there.</p>

        <p><i>Young Sp.</i> Yes, that's the chap, I fancy.</p>

        <p>Now that kind of thing starts you very nicely for the
        day. It isn't necessary that either of the sportsmen whose
        dialogue has been reported should believe implicitly in the
        absolute truth of what he is saying. Observe, neither of
        them says that he himself met this man. He merely gets
        conversation out of him on the strength of what someone
        else has told him. That, you see, is the real trick of the
        thing. Don't bind yourself to such a story as being part of
        your own personal experience. Work it in on another man's
        back. Of course there are exceptions even to this rule. But
        this question I shall be able to treat at greater length
        when I come to deal with the important subject of "Shooting
        Anecdotes."</p>

        <p>Very often you can work up quite a nice little
        conversation on cigarettes. Every man believes, as is
        well-known, that he possesses the only decent cigarettes in
        the country. He either&mdash;(1), imports them himself from
        Cairo, or (2), he gets his tobacco straight from a firm of
        growers somewhere in Syria and makes it into cigarettes
        himself; or (3), he thinks Egyptian cigarettes are an
        abomination, and only smokes Russians or Americans; or (4),
        he knows a man, <span class="sc">Backastopoulo</span> by
        name, somewhere in the Ratcliffe Highway, who has
        <i>the</i> very best cigarettes you ever tasted. You
        wouldn't give two-pence a hundred for any others after
        smoking these, he tells you. And, lastly, there is the man
        who loathes cigarettes, despises those who smoke them, and
        never, smokes anything himself except a special kind of
        cigar ornamented with a sort of red and gold garter.</p>

        <p>Out of this conflict of preferences the young shooter
        can make capital. By flattering everybody in turn, he can
        practically get his smoking gratis, for everyone will be
        sure to offer him at least one cigarette, in order to prove
        the superiority of his own particular kind. And if the
        young shooter, after smoking it, expresses a proper amount
        of ecstasy, he is not at all unlikely to have a second
        offered to him. Most men are generous with cigarettes. Many
        a man I know would far rather give a beggar a cigarette
        than a shilling, though the cigarette may have cost,
        originally, a penny-halfpenny, or more&mdash;a strange and
        paradoxical state of affairs.</p>

        <p>Here is a final piece of advice. Admire all
        cigarette-cases, and say of each that it's the very best
        and prettiest you ever saw. You can have no notion how much
        innocent pleasure you will give.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
